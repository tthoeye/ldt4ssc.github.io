LDT4SSC is an international European project bringing together partners from across governments, industry, research, and civil society to help cities and communities work smarter and more sustainably. By connecting local digital twins — virtual models of cities and services — the project will help communities across Europe share data, tools, and solutions to tackle common challenges like climate change, energy use, air quality, and waste. Building on existing EU initiatives and working with ongoing efforts like CitiVerse, LDT4SSC will support 15–20 real-world pilot projects and create a shared digital foundation to make advanced, AI-driven services accessible and reusable across borders, in line with Europe's digital and green goals.

The managing consortium of this projects consists of:
